## About

Collect stars on this space platformer!

Made for the One Button Jam 2022. Hence, only one button is needed to play!

Inspirations: Out There Somewhere, Kirby, Metroid, Wallker Demolition Co., Gravitron Experiment (yeah, I ended up taking using two of our other games as reference here and there).
